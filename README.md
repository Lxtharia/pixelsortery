# Pixelsortery - A Pixelsorter App written in Rust!

Inspired by [ASDFPixelSort](https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort) by [Kim Asendorf](https://kimasendorf.com/)!
I've written a few Pixelsorters before:
- My first one originated from modifying the original processing code until it became a little Java Swing Application: [Pixel-Sorter-App](https://github.com/Lxtharia/pixel-sorter-app).
- My second implementation was in C. It may or may not have been faster and the code was a mess, but it was usable from the command line!
- But now I have engineered THIS pixelsorter with _far greater goals_, created as a rust practice project but striving to be BEST and FASTEST FOSS-Pixelsorter of them all (maybe)!!!

## Showcase


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95c1d76e-752e-46b3-9ed4-d9da214b1547


## Installation

Download the binaries from the Releases page [here](https://github.com/Lxtharia/pixelsortery/releases) or build it from source

### Building from source
Ensure rust and cargo are installed, then type this on the command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lxtharia/pixelsortery
cd pixelsortery
cargo install
```

## Usage (GUI)
To start the gui double-click it or run the binary from the command line without any arguments.

You can also pass the --gui flag on the command line to apply other options when opening the GUI.
```bash
pixelsortery --gui --input image.png --diagonal 30
```
This would for example open the gui with the image already loaded and the direction set to diagonal with a 30Â° angle

## Usage (CLI)
The `--help` output is probably more up-to-date than this README will ever be and is nicely formatted.
1. Simply run
```bash
pixelsortery --help
```
2. Read the explanation below to understand what's going on
3. And start experimenting with it!

```bash
# Very simple usage example
pixelsortery -i input.png -o output.png --right --random 200 --mapsort 

# Usage example 
pixelsortery -i image.png --diagonal 30 --thres hue:10:40 --glitchsort --output sortedimg.png

# You can also chain commands by reading and writing to stdin/stdout (by setting the filename to `-`)
pixelsortery -i image.png --diagonal 30 --output - | pixelsortery --input - --hilbert --glitchsort --output doublesortedimg.png
```

## Explanation (How it works)

The pixelsorter is quite modular to allow for easy extension in the future.
There are three main stages in the sorting process:

1. **Creating Paths**
    - Usually determines the sorting "direction", but can be much more
    - Defines the order in which pixels are processed
    - Allows to sort in horizontal or vertical lines
    - Allows to sort in different shapes like spirals
    - Allows to sort in a space filling fractal, the [hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve)
        - Gilbert algorithm taken from [jakubcerveny](https://github.com/jakubcerveny/gilbert)
2. **Selecting**
    - The magic behind the cool pixelsort-effect: we only sort _intervals_ of pixels (lets call them "spans")
    - We are iterating pixels in whatever order the iteration has yielded them
    - We select these intervals by grouping similar pixels together
    - Examples:
        - Group (select) bright pixels (pixels with their brightness value between 180 and 255)
        - Select blue pixels (pixels with their hue value between 190 and 240)
    - All other pixels, not fulfilling this requirement, will not get sorted
    - We only group pixels that come after each other, so (D, B, B, D, D, B, D) gives us the spans (B, B) and (B) 
        - With B being a "bright" pixel and D being a "dark" one, following the previous example
3. **Sorting**
    - Finally, sorting
    - You can sort by different criteria
    - Usually sorting by Brightness looks the most smooth
    - You can also change the sorting algorithm, which mostly has impact on performance, but could - in theory - create different results (see [Sorting algorithm stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability))

## Features

- [x] Choose to sort lines in all 4 directions
- [x] Sort pixels _diagonally_, in rectangular shape, in circles, 
- [x] Sort pixels in the shape of the space filling hilbert curve (very sweet)
- [x] Choose to select spans of random or fixed length
- [x] Choose to select spans based on their hue/brightness/saturation
- [x] Sorts pixel with MAPSORT (HELL YEAH!!)
- [x] Also allows to use a COMPLETELY BROKEN sorting algorithm, creating a super rad glitch effect (try out)
- [x] A super cool CLI interface!
- [x] Read input from stdin and write to stdout, allowing easy chaining
- [x] a GUI (holy damn)
- [x] a really good GUI (damn holy)
- [x] Sort _multiple_ times with layers

## Planned Features

- [ ] a godlike GUI where you can edit masks in real time (holy cow!)
- [ ] Add more pattern patterns to sort by (sin waves, star shape, ...)
- [ ] Allow to read custom pathing data from file
- [ ] Allow to use MASKS to control which areas should be sorted and which shouldn't
- [ ] Allow to logically combine selectors (sort pixels that are bright _and_ red)
- [ ] Built-in animation (low prio)
